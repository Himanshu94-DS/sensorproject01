## Machine Learning sensor project 

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

In semiconductor manufacturing, a wafer is a thin slice of semiconductor material, like silicon, that serves as the foundation for integrated circuits. The fabrication process is highly complex, and even minor deviations can lead to defective chips, resulting in significant financial loss and production delays.

This project tackles a critical industrial challenge: the early detection of faulty wafers. By leveraging machine learning on sensor data collected during the fabrication process, we can predict the quality of a wafer (Good or Bad) in real-time. This allows manufacturers to identify and remove defective units early, saving resources, improving yield, and minimizing production downtime.
